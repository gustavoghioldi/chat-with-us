# Debug Toolbar Issue Resolution

## Problem
An error was occurring when trying to import `debug_toolbar` because there was a malformed management command in `/main/management/__init__.py` that contained Django Command class code instead of proper package initialization.

## Root Cause
The `/main/management/__init__.py` file contained a full Django management command class with debug_toolbar import statements, which was being executed whenever the management package was imported. This caused the AttributeError: `module 'debug_toolbar' has no attribute '__version__'` since django-debug-toolbar was properly removed from the project.

## Solution
1. **Cleaned up `/main/management/__init__.py`**: Removed the management command code and left only a simple package initialization comment.

2. **Created proper management command**: Moved the useful configuration checking functionality to a new management command at `/main/management/commands/verify_config.py` without the debug_toolbar references.

3. **Verified all systems**: Tested that all Django management commands now work properly:
   - `python manage.py check` - No issues
   - `python manage.py verify_config` - Works properly
   - `python manage.py check_config` - Works properly
   - `python manage.py dev_info` - Works properly
   - `python manage.py showmigrations` - Works properly

## Files Modified
- `/main/management/__init__.py` - Cleaned up to proper package initialization
- `/main/management/commands/verify_config.py` - New management command (created)

## Result
- Django Debug Toolbar removal is now complete and error-free
- All existing management commands continue to work
- New verify_config command provides useful project configuration checking
- System passes all Django checks without errors
